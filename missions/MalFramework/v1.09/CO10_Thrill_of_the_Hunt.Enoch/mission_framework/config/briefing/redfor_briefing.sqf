<br/>TF Raven is part of the facility guard at <marker name='marker_13'>Krsnik Research Facility</marker>. The main task of the group is to protect the scientists while they are out on the field gathering data and investigating the [REDACTED]. You don't know much about what kind of research is done at the facility as a guard. As a scientist, your job is to find electromagnetic anomalies and report them to the lead scientists but you don't know more either as a low level scientist.
<br/>
<br/>Your unit was out of the wire to collect some data of a possible anomaly site when you received an emergency call from the base 30 minutes ago. You were rushing back to the base because you lost contact with the base commander. You managed to crash your vehicle on your way back due to the terrible weather conditions, thankfully nobody got injured. You decide to continue on foot and investigate what happened.

<br/> - Remember to turn up your music level. There's some background music for the full immersion. There won't be any ear-rape or jumpscare soundtrack, don't worry.
<br/> - The intel that you find is not synchronized with other players. Remember to relay your find to your mates.
<br/> - The scientists are not trained to use anything else other than pistols.
</br> - The AI hearing is enabled so they can hear you talk... and scream...
<br/> - Enjoy ;)
