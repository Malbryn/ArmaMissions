 <br/>
 <br/>The journal also mentions a secret lab NE of Pripyat. A science team is working on some sort of experiments there, however the details were redacted.

 <br/>
 <br/>It seems an experiment went wrong and a large amount of mutants have escaped the containment chambers along with anomalies and radiation. Scar decided to deploy the nuclear device called 'Blight' which was meant to purge the mutants in the Zone. He said we have only 30 minutes to reach the nuke-safe bunker near the power plant before the nuke goes off wiping everything in the Zone.
 <br/>
 <br/>He also pointed at the radio in the other room, which can be used to transmit the message about the nuke and the bunker that provides safety. However, the supplies in the bunker might be limited and might not be able to sustain too many people during the nuclear fallout. The choice is yours, do you save the other Stalkers?", 10, false, false],
